		<p class="aboutpage">Mental health is increasing amongst college students in the US. People do not have to be labeled with mental illness to be able to say you are struggling. People go through small struggles that can lead to bigger journeys and obstacles in their life.
			Students may feel it is a burden to share with others about their struggles and be afraid of what the others would do with his or her information. Our platform allows people to share their story and also view other people’s stories about their experiences
			and journeys with mental health. This encourages more open discussion on the topic of mental health. The main message of our project is that it is okay to ask for help from the people around them or from professional counselors and they don’t need
			to go through all of this alone. We hope our will project eventually be featured on the student health page so that it can be more easily found by the student body. We want to provide a safe space for people to share openly and honestly, free from
			fear of judgement, about what they are currently or have dealt with in the past and how they have healed. This is also a space where they can see other peoples stories of struggle or stories of healing. Our project is a starting point that lowers all
			‘barriers of entry’ and we are making it with the hopes that by seeing these sharings, students would feel encouraged by seeing that they aren't alone in their struggles and that it’s okay to talk them through them with actual people in their lives.
			Our project will also direct and encourage people to more tangible resources if they are really having a difficult time with something. If they see these other vulnerable stories, they may feel more encouraged to talk to an actual person to receive
			specific counseling.
