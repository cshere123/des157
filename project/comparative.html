    <h2>Never Alone</h2>

    <p>Never Alone is a puzzle platform videogame that is available across different platforms to play on. This puzzle platformer game is to educate the users of the Inupiat, an Alaska Native people, of their stories. Users will choose their main characters
      and go on an adventure to survive in the blizzard. Through this game, users will solve puzzles and unlock stories. These stories that are unlocked through the puzzles includes stories that are passed through generations of the Alaskan Native people.
      The game illustrations were influenced by the Alaskan Native crafting and paintings.</p>
    <p>The interface design works well with the game, it is both appealing and relating to the story and theme of the game. The interaction design is good also because it resembles other platform games. Users control the different main characters with a
      game control, keyboard or touch screen depending on the platform. What is great about this game is that it is available and responsible on different platforms. The overall experience of this game seems very fun while also being educational. </p>
    <p>I like that the interface design of this game looks very kid/family friendly. The design of this makes it more approachable and appealing to younger generation. The interaction design and overall experience seems like a regular platform adventure
      game that I have previously played. Using play, it is a good way to help educate younger generations. After researching on this game, I want to use a similar interaction design into my final project in such a way where users will solve puzzles and
      learn about different cultures. The interface design of this game is something for me to think about, having my final project have a theme that fits the cultures that I will be educating the users. Since the topic is on diversity, I am hoping through
      the example of Never Alone, I can have a target audience towards children since I think young generations should be exposed and educated on the topic of diversity. </p>

    <h2>NYT VR</h2>

    <img src="../images/vr-1.JPG" alt="vr-1" width=800px height=536px>
    <img src="../images/vr-2.JPG" alt="vr-2" height=800px width=498px>
    <p>The second example I chose is an app called the NYT VR which is the Virtual Reality Stories from the NYTimes. This is a documentary interactive design. This virtual reality allows for users to experience being in a different atmosphere. Users will
      be able to learn the values and lifestyle of other people who live in other countries. In this virtual reality, users will be able to walk around and look around to understand the surroundings in other countries. Through this interactive design,
      users will be able to learn and understand people who live in a different kind of environment. </p>

    <p>This activity is meant for students to learn and think about how other people are feeling and living in other places. This application is meant for discussion based in a classroom to talk about what they saw in the virtual reality. Looking at the
      interactive design, I think that the use of virtual reality has a well-played in this project because this allows for users to immerse themselves in a new environment. The interface design looks very simple, as if itâ€™s a documentary with captions
      in the middle for the users to be able to read in the process. The overall experience I think users will be able to get the most out of it. </p>

    <p>After researching and looking into this example, I would like to consider including some captions or documentary in my final project. This way, users will be able to feel like they are interacting with different types of people in new environments.
      Not only will it feel like they are interacting with the people, there will be some new information that is included to learn about different people and their background. Although by including new information may seem like the user will feel different
      towards the people, I would like for the user to think about how similar they are too.
