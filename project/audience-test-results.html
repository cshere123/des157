    <h2>Audience Testing Results</h2>
    <p>For audience testing, my users were Tracy, Adriana and Kassey. For Tracy’s feedback, she said there needed to be more information on the sharing and viewing page.  She also noted that the page with the stars seems more like the home page. From this feedback, the title page, index.html will have the gradient background and sharing and viewing page will be removed and replaced with the stars background. </p>
<br>
<p>In Adriana’s testing, she was confused with the timed animation and the stars. During the testing, she took awhile to figure out that the stars are clickable. After the testing, she shared that not only were the stars unclear about being clickable, the navigation bar was not very noticeable. From this testing, the navigation bar will have a bigger font size and the location of it will be slightly adjusted to make it more noticeable.  On the share form, a small change will be made where it says “share” will be changed to “your story” to allow users to feel more comfortable. </p>
<br>
<p>In the last testing, Kassey pointed out that the timed animation is too long. Previous audience testing pointed out that the timed animation caused the user’s confusion. From this testing, the timed animation from the index.html to the stories.html will also be removed. Instead of a timed animation, Timothea and I decided to have another html page that allows for a button to be clicked to proceed to the stories.html page where the stars can be clicked to view other people’s stories.  </p>
