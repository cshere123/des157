    <p>For my first paper prototype, I wanted to have an easy flow for the user to get through the website. Through my paper prototype, I assumed the user will go straight to sharing their story. Because of this conclusion, I did not consider adding a “share” button on the later pages for the website, which my classmate noticed and wondered about that. I also learned if a person would like to share a story after viewing all of these wireframes, there should be a way to take the “you’re not alone” since
      the user has already seen this part.</p>

    <h2>Paper Prototype 2</h2>
    <img src="project-images/paper2.jpg" alt="paper2">
    <p>For my second paper prototype, I took some considerations that my classmate gave me which is to have a css animation of the menu’s bar so that the user will know it is at the bottom of the webpage. I also considered to have the user not having to repeat the “you’re not alone” wireframe after already viewing the website. Other then that, there are very minor changes on the second paper prototype. </p>

    <h2>Paper Prototype 3</h2>
    <img src="project-images/paper3.jpg" alt="paper3">
    <p>For my third paper prototype, after receiving feedback from the professor, I wanted to add a filter selection where the user can select the category that the user’s story best fits. This way, the user can search and read other people’s specific stories. This allows for the user to find other people who have the similar struggle as he or she has too. I also reconsidered where the navigation bar should be placed. I decided to have the navigation bar at the top of the page under “Unspoken” and to remain visible. Previously, I wanted to include the CSS animation but I think it would distract the user. </p>
