    <h1>UNSPOKEN</h1>
    <h2>Topic summary</h2>
    <p>Mental health is increasing amongst college students in the US. People do not have to be labeled with mental illness to be able to say you are struggling. People go through small struggles that can lead to bigger journeys and obstacles in their life.
      Students may feel it is a burden to share with others about their struggles and be afraid of what the others would do with his or her information. Our platform allows people to share their story and also view other people’s stories about their experiences
      and journeys with mental health. This encourages more open discussion on the topic of mental health. The main message of our project is that it is okay to ask for help from the people around them or from professional counselors and they don’t need
      to go through all of this alone. </p>

    <h2>Target audience description</h2>
    <p>Our audience is the UC Davis Student community. The best place to start is here, in our immediate community. Our project is geared specifically towards students that are afraid of stigma or blah blah to talk about these things with actual people they
      know.
    </p>

    <h2>The goals of the project (and how it will work)</h2>
    <p>We hope our will project eventually be featured on the student health page so that it can be more easily found by the student body. We want to provide a safe space for people to share openly and honestly, free from fear of judgement, about what they
      are currently or have dealt with in the past and how they have healed. This is also a space where they can see other peoples stories of struggle or stories of healing. Our project is a starting point that lowers all ‘barriers of entry’ and we are
      making it with the hopes that by seeing these sharings, students would feel encouraged by seeing that they aren't alone in their struggles and that it’s okay to talk them through them with actual people in their lives. Our project will also direct
      and encourage people to more tangible resources if they are really having a difficult time with something. If they see these other vulnerable stories, they may feel more encouraged to talk to an actual person to receive specific counseling.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals for the overall look and feel (visual strategies, such as formal details including color and type)</h2>
    <p>The goals for the overall look and feel for our project is to include a background color of a very dark blue and purple shade. The shapes that represent people’s stories will be circles. Stories of healing will be indicated by yellow and the stories
      of struggles will be indicated by green. The typefaces that will be used are Libre Baskerville as the headlines while Lato as the body copy. The overall look of this project is to illustrate an “open-world” similar to how a galaxy will look. The
      user will be able to interact with the different circles that will be glowing. Users can click on the stories to view the stories of healing or struggles. The visual strategies will allow users to feel calm and relaxed while viewing this project.</p>
