      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Articles that I looked were on the topic of app design and topics that relate to diversity. I still do not know exactly what specific topic I want to focus on for the final project. Currently, I want to work towards in creating an app design or
        interactive design that relates to social awareness of cultural ethnic differences.</p>
      <p>For the background research, I first looked into app design and interactive design. I found a couple articles regarding these topics. Since I never made either one, I wanted to see what kinds of tips and advices I can find in order to have a successful
        project. One of the things I found useful when reading through the “Complete Beginner’s Guide to Interaction Design” and “What Everyone Should Know About The Process Behind App Design” is the usability and frame working. Since I am creating something
        for a user, I have to think about what the process I want the user to go through and how I am going to give the best experience for them is. Some of the tips I read was to have the idea and prototype or draw out the wireframe and create mockups
        in order for me to know what the users will be going through each step for whatever I create for the final project.</p>
      <p>The next step after looking into how I want my users to interact and use what I programmed and design is, what do I want my users to learn and get out of it? Since the topic I am trying to focus on is about diversity, specifically something related
        to social awareness of cultural ethnic differences, I want to find out what kinds of news there is on this topic or even on diversity itself. I found a couple articles regarding how diversity has affected our society. The first article I found
        was called “Diversity Doesn’t Stick Without Inclusion.” This article talks about how certain gender and race can put a person in a specific role in a workplace environment that may benefit them as a leader or just a regular employee. For an example,
        one part of an article states that in some industries, women who act “like a man” are more likely to have an advantage of becoming a leader. Not only that those who are in the LGBT community, of color or women tend to have less attention and opportunities
        in workplace environment. By the end of the article, I found that this part is very important “Diversity without inclusion is a story of missed opportunities.” The authors, Laura Sherbin and Ripa Rashid article focuses and talks about the amount
        of work and effort that a person who is of LGBT community, color or a woman has to put into work in order to have equality within a workplace.
      </p>
      <p>The second article I found is called “Beyond the Classroom: The impact of culture on the classroom.” In this article, the author Laurie Futterman discusses on the topic of how educators may educate students on the topic of cultural differences.
        The importance of educating people on cultural differences can influence people’s approach to learning and school performance. For an example, in the article the authors gave examples of how Asians, Europeans and Hispanics will behave differently
        in a classroom setting because of their culture backgrounds. Behavior and treatment towards others are different within different cultures. It is important for people to know about this so that there is no misunderstandings among students, teachers
        and also people who are outside of the classroom. </p>
