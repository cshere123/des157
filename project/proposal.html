    <h1>DIS Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>What happens to students when there is less resources and no one to ask for help? Internal audit reveals a decline in recruiting additional counselors at UC Davis from $250,000 funds. Back in 2016, UC Office President promised to hire 85 mental health
      clinicians and 12 counseling psychologists at UC Davis. However, the audit in December 2017 reveals that $250,000 of mental health funds for UC Davis is spent elsewhere. Students on campus protested at Davis Town Hall and demanded to have the additional
      counseling services that was promised back in 2016. Students already pay for services and wishes to have the proper health care. It was found in 2015 from a survey that 40% of undergraduate students at UC Davis were so depressed they cannot function
      on a daily basis; while 12% from the survey have considered suicide. Despite the recent rise in tuition cost, there has not been any additional mental health support. Students who are in need of service may be told they cannot have an appointment
      until few weeks later for the next availability. Sources: <a href="https://theaggie.org/2018/02/22/mental-health-town-hall-erupts-protest/">the aggie</a>

    <h2>Target audience</h2>
    <p>Our audience is the UC Davis Student community. The best place to start is here, in our immediate community. Our project is geared specifically towards students that are afraid of stigma or blah blah to talk about these things with actual people they
      know.
    </p>

    <h2>Description of Form</h2>
    <p>Mental health is increasing amongst college students in the US. People do not have to be labeled with mental illness to be able to say you are struggling. People go through small struggles that can lead to bigger journeys and obstacles in their life.
      Students may feel it is a burden to share with others about their struggles and be afraid of what the others would do with his or her information. Our platform allows people to share their story and also view other people’s stories about their experiences
      and journeys with mental health. This encourages more open discussion on the topic of mental health. The main message of our project is that it is okay to ask for help from the people around them or from professional counselors and they don’t need
      to go through all of this alone. We hope our will project eventually be featured on the student health page so that it can be more easily found by the student body. We want to provide a safe space for people to share openly and honestly, free from
      fear of judgement, about what they are currently or have dealt with in the past and how they have healed. This is also a space where they can see other peoples stories of struggle or stories of healing. Our project is a starting point that lowers
      all ‘barriers of entry’ and we are making it with the hopes that by seeing these sharings, students would feel encouraged by seeing that they aren't alone in their struggles and that it’s okay to talk them through them with actual people in their
      lives. Our project will also direct and encourage people to more tangible resources if they are really having a difficult time with something. If they see these other vulnerable stories, they may feel more encouraged to talk to an actual person
      to receive specific counseling.
