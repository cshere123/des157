      <h3>Satisfaction:</h3>
      <p> The idea of students being able to read anonymous stories will motivate students to use this website. This way it will motivate people to share their stories and feel they are not the only ones to go through this. This enables people to feel more belonging. The need that it fills is to allow for students go through. Students are not limited to only sharing, they also have the option to read other's stories to still feel the sense of belonging.</p>
